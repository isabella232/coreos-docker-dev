MySQL storage:

/var/lib/data/mysql: this is the VM's local file system.
/var/lib/apps-data: this is a symlink to /home/core/shared/apps-data

This MySQL container mounts the VM's /var/lib/data/mysql to /var/lib/mysql. 

To keep data persistent, /var/lib/data/mysql is backedup to /var/lib/apps-data/mysql

See units/mysql.service file for details.
